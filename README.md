# EccentricPROM
My modified version of the TommyPROM for the Arduino Ben Eater EEPROM programmers.

To unlock SDP(Software Data Protection) you can either test my modified files or see this tested and proved [unlock-ben-eater-hardware sketch](https://github.com/TheEccentricGenius/TommyPROM/tree/main/unlock-ben-eater-hardware).

The link to wiring up the [Ben Eater EEPROM
Programmer](https://github.com/beneater/eeprom-programmer).

The aim of this project is to use the Ben Eater EEPROM Programmer design, but have the functionality of the TommyPROM design.
The project will only support 28 pin EEPROM, UV PROM, or PROM....An adapter board will be designed to provide the 12V VPP
signal for chips that require more then 5V programming voltage.

For more documentation please visit [TommyPROM docs](https://github.com/TomNisbet/TommyPROM/tree/master/docs).
